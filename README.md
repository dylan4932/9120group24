# Conceptual Modelling & Logical DB Design - Brisbane 2024 Olympics System (BOS).


• Create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that captures the business concepts and requirements conveyed in this description,
• Translate your ER diagram into a logical database design including relational database schema creation, key constraints and integrity constraints.

## Background
Due to some bureaucratic errors it turns out that Paris is not meant to host the 2024 Olympics, and based upon Australia’s previous success with Sydney 2000 Olympics, the executive committee have decided to bring forward Brisbane 2032 instead. As a database consultant, you have been engaged at the last moment with designing the Brisbane Olympics System (BOS) to support the Olympics 2024 games in Brisbane, Queensland.

## Introduction
The BOS database system host a number of indispensable details. A key part of implementing this successfully is making it easy for users to find athletes and sporting events. The system must allow users to easily search for athletes by name, and browse sporting events that have been scheduled at various dates and times at different venues. You need to track information about all the sporting events that are to be held, including who the participants are (including their home country and birth country), what the events are, and what the results are. The types of information to be recorded for an event encompass the name, which sport the event is for, the result type (whether it is time-based or score-based), however the system needs to cater for Brisbane 2024 Olympics only excluding all other past nor future Olympics games.
